# The Basics

## Turning Free Wil-i On or Off

You can turn Free Wil-i on by pressing the gray button or by connecting it to USB.  You can turn Free Wil-i off by holding the red button for 5 seconds. Note when connected to USB Free Wil-i remains on.

## Using the USB interfaces

When you plug Free Wil-i into a host, it will present 3 USB serial ports. One port connects to the Free Wil-i FPGA, One port connects to the [IO App](/io-app), and the last port connects to the [GUI App](/gui-screen-buttons-and-lights) processor.

## Updating Firmware

The Free Wil-i has an integrated USB boot loader to update firmware. Please see this [topic](/ice40-fpga/free-wil-i-firmware-update).
