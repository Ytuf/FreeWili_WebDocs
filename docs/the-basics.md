# The Basics

## Turning FREE-WiLi On or Off

You can turn FREE-WiLi on by pressing the gray button or by connecting it to USB.  You can turn FREE-WiLi off by holding the red button for 5 seconds. Note when connected to USB FREE-WiLi remains on.

## Using the USB interfaces

When you plug FREE-WiLi into a host, it will present 3 USB serial ports. One port connects to the FREE-WiLi FPGA, One port connects to the [IO App](/io-app), and the last port connects to the [GUI App](/gui-screen-buttons-and-lights) processor.

## Updating Firmware

The FREE-WiLi has an integrated USB boot loader to update firmware. Please see this [topic](/freewili-firmware-update).
